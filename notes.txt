The webpack scripts which we have added in package.json will run the webpack binary 
in different mode.

Why we having different mode for webpack?
For production, webpack will do different kind of optimization and for development
it will do different kind of optimization.


Webpack are extremely configurable. We can extend the functionalities
by adding more loaders, more plugins.


When we run build:prod script, it will generate main.js in
root dist folder by default.

By default, webpack take input from src/index.js 

Why we need webpack??
===
If we try to run to src/index/js file, it will throw an error as 
we are using es module syntax.

Webpack optimization
===

1. The benefit of using watch flag is whenever we make changes in our
   javascript files, we do not have to run the "bundle:prod" command again and again.

2. Whenever when a function is imported from another file and if we are using only once
    in that case, webpack will do optimization on its own (in production mode) and it will
    not include the body or the function defination of the function.


===
Dead code removal
===
It will automatically remove or exclude the unused code in main.js
i.e. it will only include program which we are using.
In this case, it will not include multiply, divide and substract function
in main.js (final bundle)

The advantage is the bundle size will be less.

As in client side in slow network, the bundle size is really matters.

E.g. If we are using lots of libraries and if we include everything and
in scenario where we are not using 100% of the libraries.
Then user will not have good experience as javascript will keep on loading 
and it will take lots of time to load the data.
