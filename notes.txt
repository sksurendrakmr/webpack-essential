The webpack scripts which we have added in package.json will run the webpack binary 
in different mode.

Why we having different mode for webpack?
For production, webpack will do different kind of optimization and for development
it will do different kind of optimization.


Webpack are extremely configurable. We can extend the functionalities
by adding more loaders, more plugins.


When we run build:prod script, it will generate main.js in
root dist folder by default.

By default, webpack take input from src/index.js 

Why we need webpack??
===
If we try to run to src/index/js file, it will throw an error as 
we are using es module syntax.
